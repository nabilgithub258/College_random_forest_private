# README: College Private Status Prediction

This repository contains a predictive model built in R using a Random Forest algorithm to determine whether a college is private or not based on certain features.

### Model Details
The predictive model employs a Random Forest classifier, which utilizes an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions. It has been trained on a labeled dataset where each college is categorized as either private or non-private.

### Instructions

Please read the pdf which is a RMarkdown converted to pdf for better and cleaner understanding of what is going on and how we model and predict, including all the packages and libraries we need to run the model.

### Note
This model provides predictions based on the data it was trained on. Its accuracy may vary depending on the quality and relevance of the input features.
